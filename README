to try this out, clone the repo to your machine.

REPL key: anything prefixed with '>>> ' is a command. anything else is the expected output.

open 2 terminals and cd into the cloned repo in both.
run the command `git checkout one`
in one terminal start a python repl (just type `python`. ipython works too.)
in the REPL run:

    >>> import imp
    >>> master = imp.load_source("master", "master.py")
    loading builder
    this is the original builder
    blarg
    AAAAA


Note: Do not exit the REPL. Leave it open.
in the other terminal run `git checkout two`
go back to the repl and run:

    >>> master = imp.load_source("master", "master.py")
    loading builder v2
    this is the second builder version
    blarg
    AAAAA

If you check the source code in builders/_common_config.py though, you will see that the var has changed to 'BBBBBBB' and the function should now print 'rawr'. which is not showing up as you can see.

now go back to the other terminal again and run `git checkout three`
go back to the repl one more time and run:

    >>> master = imp.load_source("master", "master.py")
    loading builder v3
    this is the third builder
    honk
    BBBBBBB


which is what we expect.
